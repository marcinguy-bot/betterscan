For Paying Customers MK will not limit the essential functions of the SaaS. MK reserves the right to enforce quotas and usage limits (to any resources, including the API) or to disable Customer’s account at its sole discretion, with or without notice, which may result in MK disabling or throttling Customer’s usage of the Service for any amount of time if bandwidth, storage, API request or other resources significantly exceed the average usage (as determined solely by MK) of other MK Customers. <br><br>

Adjustments, changes and updates of the SaaS that help to avoid or maintain dysfunctions may lead to temporary service suspensions. MK will try to limit downtime of the service or restrictions of accessibility to 10 hours a month. MK will try to do regular maintenance works during the weekend or at times between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. (CET). Customer is aware that the SaaS relies on a working internet infrastructure. Additional downtime of the SaaS may occur, if the website is not available in whole or in part, e.g. because of interrupted broadband connection. Customer is aware that the SaaS may not work if Customer’s Repository Hosting Service is not properly available (be it to MK or the Customer).</li>
									<li><strong>Support</strong>.<br><br>
									Any complaints concerning the use of the MK Services shall be notified by e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@betterscan.io">info@betterscan.io</a>. Support is only available in English.</li>

								</ol>
							</li>
							<h4>Fees, Expenses, and Taxes</h4>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Trial Period</strong>.<br> <br>
									Customer can test the SaaS paid accounts free of charge for a 14-day period beginning with the Start Date. At the end of the trial period, the paid SaaS will not be extended automatically, but will initially be downgraded to the free version, unless a subscription is purchased. Customer is made aware of this fact in good time. This means that costs will only be incurred if the Customer additionally books Fee-based product subscriptions. Only then will the Customer have to enter its payment information into the Service.</li>
									<li><strong>Invoices; Payment; Late Payment</strong>.<br> <br>
									Customer agrees to pay all prices for the SaaS subscriptions which are displayed on the MK website and confirmed by Customer. The subscription prices which can be accessed here shall apply in the version valid at the time of the conclusion of the subscription. Prices are plus statutory value added tax. Invoices will be issued by e-mail and in Euro. Payment must be made at the beginning of the subscription period, using the payment methods provided by MK and selected by Customer in its Account. If the due date for the payment is a fixed calendar date, the Customer shall be in default of payment once this date has expired. Otherwise, the Customer shall be in default after a warning letter has been sent, or, at the latest, if the Customer fails to pay an invoice within 10 days from the due date and receipt of such invoice. In the event of default, the Customer shall pay to MK default interest amounting to 9 percentage points above the applicable base rate. Should Customer fail to fulfil its payment obligations, MK reserves the right to temporarily, up until full payment has been effected, or permanently block the Customer's access to the Service. The Customer's obligation to pay default interest shall not preclude the assertion by MK of default damage going beyond this. </li>
									<li><strong>Pricing and changes</strong><br> <br>
									MK shall have the right to adjust the prices for SaaS subscriptions and subscriptions at any time, after a corresponding notification in accordance with legal requirements. Price changes and the introduction of new product subscriptions and/or subscriptions during a subscription term shall apply to subsequent terms and for all new members after the day on which such changes take effect. Unless Customer terminates this Agreement, subscription will automatically renew and Customer authorizes MK to collect then-applicable Fees (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism Customer has selected in his account.</li>
									<li><strong>Taxes</strong><br> <br>
									Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and Customer will pay MK for the Service without any reduction for Taxes. If MK is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to MK, unless Customer provides MK with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. If Customer is required by law to withhold any Taxes from its payments to MK, Customer must provide MK with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such payments.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<h4>Customer Obligations</h4>
								<ol>
									<li>Customer must be human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.</li>

									<li>MK is not responsible if Customer fails to configure, or misconfigures, the SaaS and inadvertently allows unauthorized parties to access any Customer Source Code in Private Repositories.</li>
									<li>Customer agrees to not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the SaaS such as but not limited to: (i) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the SaaS in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or non-automated “scraping”; (ii) using any automated system, including without limitation “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the SaaS in a manner that sends more request messages to the MK servers than a human being can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional online web browser.</li>
									<li>Customer is responsible to inform MK immediately about any possibility of unauthorized access to the SaaS, particularly but not exclusively because of loss of password, stolen password, loss of SSH keys, stolen SSH keys or other breach of security.</li>
									<li>Customer shall promptly notify MK of any known violation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and shall cooperate with MK with respect to: (a) investigation by MK of any suspected or alleged violation of this Agreement; and (b) any action by MK to enforce the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</li>

Particularly but not exclusively MK shall not be liable for any claims, losses, or damages (a) caused by actions taken by MK at Customer’s direction; and (b) arising out of or in connection with Customer’s or any Authorized User’s use of the SaaS in violation of the terms of this Agreement and (c) arising out of Customer’s non-compliance with the technical requirements defined in section 8 (d) arising out of unauthorized access to the SaaS (particularly but not exclusively hacking or theft of data).</li>
									<li>Except as expressly provided in section 8.1, the SaaS is provided "as is", without warranties of any kind whatsoever, express or implied, in contract, in tort or otherwise, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and accuracy of any information provided. In no event shall either party be liable for any incidental or consequential damages, including loss of income, data, profits, revenue or business interruption, or cost of substitute services, or other economic loss, whether or not such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages, and whether any claim for recovery is based on theories of contract, warranty, tort or otherwise. The limitation and exclusion of warranty and liability set forth in this section shall not apply in cases of death, personal injury, fraud or willful misconduct, where liability is legally mandated, such as under the Product Liability Act, in cases of malicious intent, gross negligence, where assurance of freedom from defect was given or in case of failure to fulfil essential contractual duties.</li>

										<li>determination that the Customer’s use of the SaaS poses a security or service risk to MK, or to any user of services offered by MK;</li>
										<li>a major change in the working of the provider of your git-server (e.g., GitHub, BitBucket, etc.) that makes it unreasonable for MK to adapt the SaaS accordingly;</li>
										<li>a major change in the co-operation of the provider of your online git-server (e.g., Github, BitBucket, etc.) and MK that makes the further offering of the SaaS unreasonable for MK;</li>
										<li>an application for the initiation of insolvency proceedings concerning the Customer, as well as the refusal to open insolvency proceedings for lack of assets, or the issue of a declaration in lieu of an oath, or any similar proceedings.</li>
									</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Upon any termination for cause by Customer, MK shall refund to Customer, within thirty (30) days, any prepaid Fees. In no event shall any termination relieve the Customer of the obligation to pay any Fees payable to MK for the period prior to the effective date of termination.
