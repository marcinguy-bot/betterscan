For Paying Customers BMK will not limit the essential functions of the SaaS. BMK reserves the right to enforce quotas and usage limits (to any resources, including the API) or to disable Customer’s account at its sole discretion, with or without notice, which may result in BMK disabling or throttling Customer’s usage of the Service for any amount of time if bandwidth, storage, API request or other resources significantly exceed the average usage (as determined solely by BMK) of other BMK Customers. <br><br>

Adjustments, changes and updates of the SaaS that help to avoid or maintain dysfunctions may lead to temporary service suspensions. BMK will try to limit downtime of the service or restrictions of accessibility to 10 hours a month. BMK will try to do regular maintenance works during the weekend or at times between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. (CET). Customer is aware that the SaaS relies on a working internet infrastructure. Additional downtime of the SaaS may occur, if the website is not available in whole or in part, e.g. because of interrupted broadband connection.

									<li><strong>Support</strong>.<br><br>
									Any complaints concerning the use of the BMK Services shall be notified by e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@betterscan.io">info@betterscan.io</a>. Support is only available in English.</li>

									<li>Customer may use the BMK brand and logo for promotion and marketing purposes with BMK’s prior written consent.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<h4>Fees, Expenses, and Taxes</h4>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Trial Period</strong>.<br> <br>
									Customer can test the SaaS paid accounts free of charge for a 14-day period beginning with the Start Date. At the end of the trial period, the paid SaaS will not be extended automatically, but will initially be downgraded to the free version, unless a subscription is purchased. Customer is made aware of this fact in good time. This means that costs will only be incurred if the Customer additionally books Fee-based product subscriptions. Only then will the Customer have to enter its payment information into the Service.</li>
									<li><strong>Invoices; Payment; Late Payment</strong>.<br> <br>
									Customer agrees to pay all prices for the SaaS subscriptions which are displayed on the BMK website and confirmed by Customer. The subscription prices which can be accessed here shall apply in the version valid at the time of the conclusion of the subscription. Prices are plus statutory value added tax. Invoices will be issued by e-mail and in Euro. Payment must be made at the beginning of the subscription period, using the payment methods provided by BMK and selected by Customer in its Account. If the due date for the payment is a fixed calendar date, the Customer shall be in default of payment once this date has expired. Otherwise, the Customer shall be in default after a warning letter has been sent, or, at the latest, if the Customer fails to pay an invoice within 10 days from the due date and receipt of such invoice. In the event of default, the Customer shall pay to BMK default interest amounting to 9 percentage points above the applicable base rate. Should Customer fail to fulfil its payment obligations, BMK reserves the right to temporarily, up until full payment has been effected, or permanently block the Customer's access to the Service. The Customer's obligation to pay default interest shall not preclude the assertion by BMK of default damage going beyond this. </li>
									<li><strong>Pricing and changes</strong><br> <br>
									BMK shall have the right to adjust the prices for SaaS subscriptions and subscriptions at any time, after a corresponding notification in accordance with legal requirements. Price changes and the introduction of new product subscriptions and/or subscriptions during a subscription term shall apply to subsequent terms and for all new members after the day on which such changes take effect. Unless Customer terminates this Agreement, subscription will automatically renew and Customer authorizes BMK to collect then-applicable Fees (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism Customer has selected in his account.</li>
									<li><strong>Taxes</strong><br> <br>
									Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and Customer will pay BMK for the Service without any reduction for Taxes. If BMK is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to BMK, unless Customer provides BMK with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. If Customer is required by law to withhold any Taxes from its payments to BMK, Customer must provide BMK with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such payments.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>

									<li>Customer is responsible to inform BMK immediately about any possibility of unauthorized access to the SaaS, particularly but not exclusively because of loss of password, stolen password, loss of SSH keys, stolen SSH keys or other breach of security.</li>
									<li>Customer shall promptly notify BMK of any known violation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and shall cooperate with BMK with respect to: (a) investigation by BMK of any suspected or alleged violation of this Agreement; and (b) any action by BMK to enforce the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</li>
